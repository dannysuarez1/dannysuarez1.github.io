<p>The aim of our Industrial Counterbalance Forklift training course is to provide the candidate with the essential knowledge and skill to perform his tasks to the highest Industrial Counterbalanced Forklift training courses last between 1-5 days depending upon the requirements of the participants (refresher courses, intensive courses etc.), with partakers developing essential skills like machine operation, health and safety, and accepted good practice.

That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
