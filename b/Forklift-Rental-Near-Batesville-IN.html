OSHA defines a powered industrial truck (PIT) as any mobile, power-propelled truck used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, whether ridden by the operator or controlled by a walking operator.</p>

If you are driving aggressively in a lifted vehicle, it is a lot easier to spot the infraction and track your lifted truck down.</p>
<p>Always drive unloaded trucks with the forks downgrade. Have brakes set and wheel blocks in place to prevent movement of trucks, trailers, or railroad cars while loading or unloading.
