Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can.

<p>To obtain a forklift licence in any State or Territory an applicant must undertake a training course with an approved training organisation and then, on completion of the course, apply to the appropriate State or Territory for a forklift licence.
