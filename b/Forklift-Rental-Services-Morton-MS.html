<p>The pump 'top-of-stroke' hydraulic fluid bypass minimizes stress on the system when load is raised to maximum lift height. Our GMC truck sales team will walk you through the modifications of the lifted truck and make you a top offer. Some of these Class VII trucks are equipped with a traditional, or fixed, mast while others use a telescopic style. Raymond® Type E and EE trucks are designed and manufactured to operate in classified locations as defined in NFPA 505.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you're towing a heavy load, a lifted suspension provides the benefit of having more room to settle before the weight of the load bottoms out. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test # OP1 or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable. The new Toyota high capacity reach forklifts are developed for intensive stacking applications focusing on productivity, reliability, ergonomics (controls, steering and seat adapted to the driver's needs) and most importantly safety.</p>
