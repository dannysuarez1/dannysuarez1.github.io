Lifted Jeeps are particularly popular for driving off-road and on rough terrain due to their additional ground clearance and the ability to use larger tires and wheels. There is a common misconception regarding forklift licenses and the corresponding training.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
