<p>Class 3: Electric Motor Hand or Hand-Rider Trucks. Using the add-a-leaf will increase the height, but sometimes makes the suspension ride rough because of the added spring rate. Rough terrain forklifts are perfect for moving heavy loads across rugged terrains.

Many locations have specialized car dealerships that work with modified vehicles such as lifted trucks. The reach truck typically works as part of a material-handling system where two requirements are equally important: cube utilization (ratio of occupied space to total cubic space available, usually expressed as a percentage) and selectivity (amount or percentage of product in a warehouse which is accessible to the aisle for picking).</p>
<p>The new lift truck is powered by a 4-cylinder, 2-liter LP engine with powershift transmission. Mitsubishi counterbalance forklifts are designed for exceptional comfort and increased productivity - from beginning of the shift to the end.
