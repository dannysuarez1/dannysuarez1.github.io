<p>Never use a diesel engine, internal combustion gas, or propane powered lift truck models in confined spaces for long periods of time. Yet large trucks can't be raised and driven safely until their brakes are modified.

<p>Furthermore, these rough terrain forklifts double as workhorses in the bush here in Australia.
