<p>Debating whether to rent versus buy a forklift or other material handling equipment? Pallet jacks come in a several types , including manual kinds, as well as electric-powered units, but the basic design is always the same: Two forks are positioned horizontal to the floor, allowing the operator to slide the jack under a pallet. Cherry Pickers are found in warehouse environments where they prepare orders for shipment using the cherry picker machine.</p>
<p>That's why our focus is making the forklift rental process quick and easy, without the usual red tape and fine print of the big rental companies. The 37-inch-wide C-G chassis—about five to six inches narrower than the chassis of a typical 4,000 to 7,000 lb. forklift—allows C-G Series forklifts to navigate tight rack storage aisles. Our stores in Sacramento, CA and throughout northern central California are fully equipped to meet your demands for rental forklifts.</p>

<p>A subtype of the warehouse forklift, side loaders are usually found in steel service centers and manufacturing facilities with heavy and bulky items. Ensure that loads on pallets are stable, neat, cross-tied if possible, and evenly distributed. A reach truck looks like a very small type of counterbalance forklift. Lifted cars have the potential to run right over smaller vehicles in the event of a high-speed accident.</p>
<p>Instead, pump trucks rely on good old-fashioned manual labor as the operator pumps” the jack to lift the skids with their own force. Inquire about specific used forklifts that are in your price range and meet your requirements.

Our clients can avail from us a qualitative range of Hydraulic Pallet Truck. Lifted cars can be dangerous, especially if you're driving behind them. Keep all parts of your body inside the industrial lift truck when travelling; travel with the forks as low to the floor as possible; decrease speed around corners and sound the horn; and, travel in reverse when a load obstructs your vision.</p>
<p>You can always combine the best of both worlds, however, by choosing a great off-road focused Chevy truck, and then getting it lifted for even better clearance and larger tires. Reduced Downtime At Your Facility - During scheduled or emergency repairs our Rental and Service Departments can work together to provide you with trucks on rent to cover your shifts while your machines are in the shop.</p>
