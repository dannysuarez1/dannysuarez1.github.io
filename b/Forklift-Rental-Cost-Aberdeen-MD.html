When you want the latest and greatest in forklift tech for your business, it's typically easier to rent than buy. These mobile, self-loading trucks are power-propelled to carry, push, pull, lift, stack or tier material.</p>
<p>Featuring a hydraulic jack that is manually operated from the handle, the manual pallet jack gets it name from the manual pump input to raise the fork. Thanks to their high capacity of up to three tons and excellent manoeuvrability in even the tightest of spaces, hand pallet trucks represent ideal warehouse aids.
