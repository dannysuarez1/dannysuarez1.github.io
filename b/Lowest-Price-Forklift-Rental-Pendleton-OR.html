<p>Forklift is a small industrial vehicle, having a power operated forked platform attached at the front that can be raised and lowered for insertion under a cargo to lift or move it. Forklifts serve the needs of various industries including warehouses and other large storage facilities. We have uniquely positioned ourselves as a topmost enterprise, engaged in offering precision engineered Electrical Pallet Truck Truck.

The car loan experts at our San Diego lease department will make absolutely sure you have the very best rates on any Chevrolet lifted truck.

<p>This is an extremely rare type of mast configuration and reduces the lifting capacity of the truck considerably.
