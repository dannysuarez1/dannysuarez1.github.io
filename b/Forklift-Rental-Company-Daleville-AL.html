<p>Powerful performance meets compact design. The forklift's AC system features precise speed control, quickly adapts to varying conditions, and varies output for continued, consistent operation. This is a person we would never invite to a party; a person whose lifted truck parked outside a restaurant we were considering would cause us to eat somewhere else. There are many good advantages of hiring material handling equipment.</p>
<p>Body lift kits are primarily used to lift up a truck or SUV either two or three inches higher. OSHA requires any forklift operators to be trained and certified to operate the powered industrial truck in the workplace and that operator's performance be evaluated on the provisions 1910.178 (I)(3) every three years. This will help determine the capacity of the forklift you need to rent.</p>

Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load. There are some specialty trucks that are used in specific industries or in certain settings, such as a sideloader that picks up and carries pallets to the side of the vehicle instead of in the front.</p>

<p>Gas powered forklifts are more popular than their electric counterparts. Although they are versatile machines, you'll need the right size for the job. Our Rental Purchase Option (RPO) provides customers with an opportunity to acquire equipment by building equity over the rental period. When properly operated and maintained, a forklift is an invaluable piece of equipment.</p>
<p>Based on region, the global pallet truck market can be segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa, and South America. That's very good for an electric forklift. These changes can actually improve the handling of a pickup, however, and there is no limit, beyond a practical one, to how much lift this kind of kit can give a truck. Whether you have seasonal business, a temporary increase in workload, or are taking on a special project with a definite endpoint, leasing a forklift is probably the way to go. And the money you save by leasing can be put into what matter most: growing the business.</p>
<p>Free Lift = The vertical distance the forks can be raised before a mast begins to telescope. The forks, supported by the two front wheels, are raised hydraulically to lift the pallet. The hydraulic forks spread up to 2.22 metres gives excellent possibilities to handle long loads such as steel beams and plastic pipes but also conventional pallets. At Cat® Lift Trucks we design and build counterbalance forklift trucks for every application.</p>
