<p>Shreeviba Equipments and Services is a professionally managed sales and service company providing high quality equipment sales, services and parts across the country to help clients meet their growing demand of logistic and warehousing requirements. Most of the time, using a gas forklift is absolutely fine, but it's not always ideal. Easy 3 position control handle‑‑ Raise, Lower, Neutral. In order to counterbalance” a heavy front load, this type of lift has significant weight toward the rear of the vehicle; this promotes overall stability, even during transport. If you are looking at pallet jacks, then it's probably because you're moving heavy equipment or products regularly.</p>
<p>So while you may find cheaper custom trucks elsewhere, we doubt they'll compare to the quality you get from us. Granite industrial carries an inventory full of used Baker and Linde forklift truck parts. Most order picker forklifts have a 4-point suspension mechanism between the rear tires and the front wheels.
