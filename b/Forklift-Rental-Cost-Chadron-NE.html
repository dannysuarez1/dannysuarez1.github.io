These Class 5 forklifts, sometimes called Yard Trucks,” are larger when compared to a Cushion tire unit of equal capacity and offer a softer ride.</p>
<p>We offer Forklift and Crane Rental Services at cost-effective prices. The counterbalance” term refers to the weight distribution for cargo loads; any pallets or merchandise are counterbalanced against the weight of the machine.
