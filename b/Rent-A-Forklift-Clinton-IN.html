<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Telehandlers look and function like forklifts, but have a telescopic boom that can extend forwards and upwards for different attachments, such as a bucket, pallet forks, or muck grab. If the forklift truck in front is driving too slow. Handling processes will be slowed down, the equipment will experience increased wear and tear, and it may even suffer serious damage under excessive loads.</p>
<p>At its 2019 National Forklift Safety Day in Washington, D.C., ITA members discussed how there are currently more than 4.5 million truck operations currently employed in more than 300 industries nationwide. Class VII - Rough terrain forklift trucks comprise Class VII, including straight-mast forklifts and extended-reach forklifts.
