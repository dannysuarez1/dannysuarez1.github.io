Knowing your specific needs and what forklift type best fits your application is very important when renting equipment for your job site.

Ohio Power Tool carries a vast selection of pumps - including dewatering, diaphragm, sewage, sump, and trash varieties - from top names in tool manufacturing ( Chicago Pneumatic , Greenlee , Multiquip , RIDGID , and Wheeler-Rex ).

LOAD CENTER: The horizontal longitudinal distance from the intersection of the horizontal load-carrying surfaces and vertical load-engaging faces of the forks (or equivalent load positioning structure) to the center of gravity of the load.</p>
<p>A rental can also serve as a test drive,‚Äù allowing you to test out different types of equipment to determine what you want to purchase. These permit the truck to drive over bumpy terrain without harming the vehicle's under-body. This abrasion can reduce the thickness of a fork until it cannot lift loads up to the designed capacity.

Electric counterbalanced truck shows that it has actually eclipsed the performance specifications of most internal combustion trucks.</p>
