<p>Not ready to buy new but need a material handling solution right away we have a good selection of used material handling equipment to choose from on a regular basis. A lifted truck with a higher center of gravity is not going to handle the way a stock truck with a lower center of gravity is. Forget tight turns and swift maneuvering on a lifted truck. Improperly installed lift kits will make for a rougher ride at best, and will be a tremendous safety hazard at worst. Designed for heavy loads, high reach, and extreme maneuverability, a forklift can make quick work of moving, loading, storing and unloading all sorts of loads.</p>
<p>This Course has been designed for potential and existing plant operators who have received no formal instruction and those requiring refresher training. Rental forklifts are maintained to Crown's high standards and undergo comprehensive pre-rental inspections to ensure consistent performance and reliable operations. Buying vertical order pickers comes in handy when the main job is order picking at increased requirements for productivity.</p>
