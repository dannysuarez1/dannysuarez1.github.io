<p>Operate powered industrial trucks to load and unload materials and deliveries and move them to and from storage areas, machines and loading docks, into railroad cars or trucks or storage facilities. The two forks on the front of the truck slide underneath palletised loads, to lift and transport safely. Because rough terrain vertical mast forklifts are larger and made to handle heavier loads than vertical mast counterbalanced forklifts (classes 1, 4 and 5), they require more space to operate as well as a sturdy surface that offers substantial support. Call Andy Putnam, Rental Manager (315) 413-4150 or use the Rentals Request form to send us a Quick Request.</p>
<p>Forklift Rentals - Our fully stocked rental department can deliver equipment next day for short or long term rentals. That's why Linde Material Handling uses trucks with a modular design for its picking devices, in order to help to minimize physical strain on the driver and increase the efficiency of the picking process in any working environment. We understand that downtime is a killer in any material handling business, and we promise to get your equipment up and running as quickly as possible.</p>
<h2>Hydraulic Pallet Trucks, Hand Truck Eight Mile </h2>
<p>These sit-down rough terrain forklifts have all been checked upon purchase to determine that they are in good working order. The reach forklift is capable of performing the same types of work as the counterbalance and can be fitted with attachments for special lifting jobs as required. When a 15,500 lb. forklift isn't enough, you'll need a high-capacity cushion forklift to get the job done.</p>
<p>If working spaces are tight and pedestrians or other trucks may cross your path, the braking system of a pallet truck must function perfectly. We carry a variety of pallet jacks, narrow aisle lift trucks, order pickers, and other cushion tire forklifts. We sell many of the leading brands of forklifts and other material handling equipment including Linde. Check your equipment before your shift because your fork lift is your responsibility, wear the proper gear, good footwear and a hard hat and enter and exit the forklift carefully.</p>
<p>A rental can also serve as a test drive,‚Äù allowing you to test out different types of equipment to determine what you want to purchase. These permit the truck to drive over bumpy terrain without harming the vehicle's under-body. This abrasion can reduce the thickness of a fork until it cannot lift loads up to the designed capacity. Apart from this, a feedback of the spec sheet for Jungheinrich's 5000 lb. Electric counterbalanced truck shows that it has actually eclipsed the performance specifications of most internal combustion trucks.</p>
