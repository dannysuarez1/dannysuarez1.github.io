Lifted truck up-fits are either for utility, such as enhancing your truck's capabilities and performance, or to improve its appearance. A lifted body and large tires give you a domineering stance on the road.</p>

They can reach heights up to 390″ Orderpickers are typically powered by 24- or 36-volt industrial batteries.
