<h2>Difference Between Forklifts Vs Pallet Jacks in Cowpens </h2>
<p>Despite being used, all of our rough terrain forklifts are of a high standard. However, forklift trucks come in a number of different sizes and models.

<p>Some order pickers actually load their pallets into trucks. Drivers in lifted trucks need to be especially vigilant for anybody entering or exiting their blind spots. It gets a lot more complicated when we add the weight of a load to the forklift, and raise that load in the air. When the first mast reaches maximum height, the second mast will extend. If you are lacking capital to purchase a forklift, or fleet of forklifts, we have flexible financing options available to help you secure the equipment that you need now.</p>
