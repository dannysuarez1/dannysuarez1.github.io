<p>The M series is the first generation forklifts, designed by the MAXIMAL engineering team. The China Pallet Trucks market holds a major value share in the global market and is likely maintain its dominance in the global Pallet Trucks market over the forecast period. We offer forklift sales and rentals that include everything from pallet stackers to reach trucks. As forklift operators need to sit in their machine for hours together, a high-quality adjustable seat is essential.</p>
<p>Reach trucks have baselegs extending from the tractor to support the load. Some of the pallet trucks also independently reduce high speeds when cornering, adjust their drive behavior to the current situation, or help when climbing gradients. Rather than increasing the distance between the body and the frame, a suspension lift kit either replaces or adjusts the truck's leaf springs to lift its suspension.</p>

These types of forklifts are faster and much more powerful than electric forklifts, but are also much louder.
