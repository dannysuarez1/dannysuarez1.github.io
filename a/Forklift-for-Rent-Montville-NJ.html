<p>Largely intended for safety during forward reach operation, they prevent rollovers by elevating the front tires off the ground and counterbalancing the extra weight. Their upfront price is the inverse of electric, making IC forklifts initially cheaper than electric models, but they cost more per hour to run. At Durante Rentals, we rent forklifts and telehandlers for all your material handling needs.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
<p>You may also ask to view the forklift's service record or work orders. Figure out whether you want to stick close to Ohio or are up for a road trip, and then consider one of these great vacation spots to visit in your lifted Jeep.
