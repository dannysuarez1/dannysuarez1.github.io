The China Pallet Trucks market holds a major value share in the global market and is likely maintain its dominance in the global Pallet Trucks market over the forecast period. We offer forklift sales and rentals that include everything from pallet stackers to reach trucks.

<p>That's why our focus is making the forklift rental process quick and easy, without the usual red tape and fine print of the big rental companies. The 37-inch-wide C-G chassis—about five to six inches narrower than the chassis of a typical 4,000 to 7,000 lb. forklift—allows C-G Series forklifts to navigate tight rack storage aisles. Our stores in Sacramento, CA and throughout northern central California are fully equipped to meet your demands for rental forklifts.</p>
<h2>What Kind of License Do I Need to Drive a Forklift in New City </h2>
<p>Do not overload a lift truck. The most common type of forklift has a heavy counterweight over the rear tires to balance the load. The height of these industrial reach forklifts also raises a concern about having collisions into doorways or overhead objects. We supply rental forklifts for the Napa Valley wine industry every year. The load capacity of a pallet jack is arguably the most important factor to consider before buying.</p>
<p>Also for rent, sit-down, stand-on or walk-behind forklifts. Pallet Trucks, as considered under the scope of the report, are used in warehouses for effective storage and supply of consumer goods. With a solid schedule of consistent and high-quality maintenance, your forklift can be relied upon to provide years of worry-free performance. Regardless of the order picker or forklift job, one thing is for certain: if your employees drive order picker trucks, they need an order picker license.</p>

Through our connections and many resources, we are always adding units to our inventory, giving you a wide selection of makes and models to suit the needs of your operation.

Forklifts come in many sizes, shapes, colors and functions. Rough terrain forklifts are larger, stronger and more durable and hence they are pricey than the average forklift.

The operator should never use the forklift as a personal lift unless wearing the proper harness and safety equipment. Counterbalance forklift trucks, the most common type, its forks protrude from the front of the machine, with no outriggers or baselegs to support the load.</p>
<p>That's why it's so important for operators to complete FLT counterbalance license training and receive their forklift operator certification.
