<p>Step 3: Choose Your Truck's Lift Height. POWERED INDUSTRIAL TRUCK: A mobile, power-driven vehicle used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier material.

A lifted body and large tires give you a domineering stance on the road.</p>
<p>It's not as easy to see vehicles around your lifted truck, especially if they're smaller passenger occupant vehicles or bikes. Like an articulated forklift, a pivoting-mast forklift can rotate its mast at a 90-degree angle to its body. That's why it's nice to rent a forklift when required.
