While some may know forklifts primarily as a material handling appliance, there are in fact many different categories of forklifts.

<p>If you need the best solution in material movement within your factory premises then a pallet truck will assist you well. Order picker trucks are types of lift trucks that are controlled from a carriage wherein the operator stance can be found.
