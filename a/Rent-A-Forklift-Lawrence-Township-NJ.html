<p>A truck that has had its suspension modified so that it rides way too far off the ground, usually to the point where the high center of gravity could actually be dangerous. The Pivot Steer Forklift Truck is commonly used in industry both inside of a warehouse and is ideal for very narrow aisle work as the mast can be rotated 90° to either side of the truck. It keeps some of the ride characteristics you love from the factory Jeep Wrangler spring while improving the off-road performance. We have an expansive inventory of pre-owned forklifts from Hyster, Taylor, Yale, Toyota, Caterpillar, Hoist, Kalmar, TCM and other leading brands.</p>
<p>Manufacturers have models of rough terrain forklifts with load capacities ranging from 4000 to 10000 lbs. When unloaded, the forklift's center of gravity is right about here.

<p>Moving Materials: With a rough terrain forklift, moving materials around a job site is easy.

Radically lifted trucks are just another way to separate fools from their money.</p>
<p>You can set them up with work-saver forks (roughly about 9” wide), and they lift pallets some few inches from the ground. Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load. There are some specialty trucks that are used in specific industries or in certain settings, such as a sideloader that picks up and carries pallets to the side of the vehicle instead of in the front.</p>
<p>This can occur if the forklift has loads that are over its designed capacity. Keep in mind that the higher you are lifting a load the lower the capacity will become. Self-driving forklifts, blockchain technology, ergonomic designs, virtual reality and lithium-ion batteries are all components of today's material handling equipment. In other cases, you may find that there are fellow lifted truck enthusiasts in the area who can provide you with additional information.</p>
