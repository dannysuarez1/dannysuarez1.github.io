As a result of the flip-up driver platform and Click-2-Creep, these powered pallet trucks are ideal for working in confined areas and for loading and unloading lorries.</p>
<p>Reach forklifts exemplify these features as they can reach higher storage levels than standard models and have a better control response time. Standard 2-ton counterbalance forklifts can cost over $20,000 in good condition, and many cost much more when brought brand new.
