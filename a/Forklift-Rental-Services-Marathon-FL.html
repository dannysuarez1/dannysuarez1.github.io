Place empty truck on initially level test platform in a position that the centerline of the truck is perpendicular to the axis of tilting of the test platform, and with the rear wheels placed in their least stable position.</p>

<p>How to choose the right forklift for your business. The spacious cab and adjustable controls offer the operator great comfort, even at height.
