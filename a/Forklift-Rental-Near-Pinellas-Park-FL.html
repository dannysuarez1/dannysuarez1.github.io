<p>Specifically engineered for the unique challenges of a narrow-aisle warehouse environment, the Crown RR 5700 features the industry's first traction control system, enhanced execution of load-handling functions, and the fastest lift and travel speeds among other available reach trucks. The aim of this course is to provide delegates with the knowledge and practical skills needed to safely operate an Industrial Masted Lift Truck. Whether a forklift will safely carry a load or will tip forward can be determined by comparing the moment (a tendency to produce motion) of both the load and the forklift. Our rental fleet stands ready to supply you with immediate equipment when a need arises.</p>

Some of the pallet trucks also independently reduce high speeds when cornering, adjust their drive behavior to the current situation, or help when climbing gradients.
