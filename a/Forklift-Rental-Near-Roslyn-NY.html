<p>Right now, drivers absolutely love vehicles capable of off-road driving. Their decision to go with a Liftking product was in part due to the versatility of Liftking's robust rough-terrain forklift,” says Mark Aldrovandi, sales manager at Liftking. The most important things to know when you choose a forklift are its size, lift and load capacity, and configuration.</p>
<p>It is imperative that you make a good sound and informed decision to ensure that you purchase the right forklift for the job within your desired budget. However, lifting provides many advantages for off-road use, including greater approach, breakover, and departure angles.
