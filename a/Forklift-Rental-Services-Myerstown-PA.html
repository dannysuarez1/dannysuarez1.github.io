With a capacity to pack them one on top of each other, our range of material handling equipment reduces the transporting time by half.</p>

These permit the truck to drive over bumpy terrain without harming the vehicle's under-body. This abrasion can reduce the thickness of a fork until it cannot lift loads up to the designed capacity.
