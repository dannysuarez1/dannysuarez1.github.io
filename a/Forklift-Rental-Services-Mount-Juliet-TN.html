Using the procedure outlined for this test an empty truck with the forks elevated to the maximum height should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 14 percent or 18 percent slope depending on whether the truck has single, rear-wheel drive (or brake) or dual wheel drive (or brakes), respectively.</p>
<p>Virtually any standard sized truck can be lifted to a certain extent or another. Some pallet jack models are able to lift loads all the way up to 15,000 pounds (6,803 kg). The forklift and load must be considered a unit with a continually varying center of gravity with every movement of the load. The pallet truck is simply for moving loads from one place to another at ground level, but it has limited reach, while the lift truck is more complex and is capable of transporting and lifting a palletised load onto a higher level or for stacking loads on top of each other.</p>
<p>Local businesses that recently purchased a new forklift may be selling the used model directly. As one of the leading manufacturers of materials handling equipment , including a sizable range of counterbalance forklift trucks, our products are designed to withstand even the harshest of environments.

<p>In trucks where the operator is seated, a vertical clearance of at least 39 inches should be maintained from the point of maximum depression of the seat under the operator to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation.
